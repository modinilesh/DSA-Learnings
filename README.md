# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

This repository contains my solutions and implementations for various data structures and algorithms in Java. I have completed the Data Structures and Algorithm course from Coding Blocks, and this repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my work throughout the course.

## Course Overview

The Data Structures and Algorithm course from Coding Blocks provided me with a solid foundation in understanding and implementing essential data structures and algorithms. The course covered various topics, including:

- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Binary Search Trees
- Graphs and Graph Algorithms
- Sorting and Searching
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms

Each topic was covered in detail, with lectures, coding exercises, and problem-solving sessions. The course emphasized not only the theoretical aspects but also the practical implementation and analysis of data structures and algorithms.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into separate directories for each data structure and algorithm covered in the course. Within each directory, you will find the following:

1. **Implementation**: Contains the Java implementation of the respective data structure or algorithm. The code is well-documented and follows standard coding practices.
2. **Examples**: Includes sample code snippets that demonstrate the usage and functionality of the data structure or algorithm.
3. **Complexity Analysis**: Provides a detailed analysis of the time and space complexity of the implemented data structure or algorithm.
4. **Problem Sets**: Contains a set of problem statements that I solved using the implemented data structures and algorithms. Each problem statement is accompanied by my solution code.

## Getting Started

To explore the code and solutions, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-structures-and-algorithms.git
   ```

2. Once cloned, you can navigate to specific directories to explore the code and problem solutions.

## Contribution

This repository primarily serves as a personal collection of my work during the Data Structures and Algorithm course. However, if you come across any issues, have suggestions for improvements, or want to contribute additional implementations or problem solutions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I would be happy to review and merge any valuable contributions.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to the instructors and mentors at Coding Blocks for providing excellent guidance and resources throughout the course. Their expertise and support greatly contributed to my understanding of data structures and algorithms.
